  <p>The dish on the left is a tasty fuel for the fast-paced Korean lifestyle, tteok are glutinous tubular rice cakes, usually submerged in gochujang, a red chilli pepper sauce. Tteok (pronounced "tok") are the chips of Korea â€“ they're sold at every food stall and eaten standing up. For the real tteokbokki experience, head to Sindang neighbourhood, where numerous restaurants liven up the dish with cabbage, onions, noodles and fishcakes. The standout place on this street is Mabongnim Tteokbokki, which has been around since 1953. This is one of the oldest eateries in a city where many restaurants open in the morning and have gone out of business by evening.

  <p>While the dish on the right is a North Korean export sometimes called Pyongyang naengmyun. Usually eaten in summer, these buckwheat noodles are served chilled, covered in diced vegetables and topped with a generous dollop of gochujang. Mixed together, it makes a refreshing meal for a hot, humid summer day. The soup version, mul naengmyun, comes in a tangy broth studded with ice flakes.
