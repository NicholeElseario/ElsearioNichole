  <p>Seoul, Korean Sŏul, formally Sŏul-t’ŭkpyŏlsi (“Special City of Seoul”), city and capital of South Korea (the Republic of Korea).
  It is located on the Han River (Han-gang) in the northwestern part of the country, with the city centre some 37 miles (60 km) inland from the
  Yellow Sea (west). Seoul is the cultural, economic, and political centre of South Korea.</p>
  <p>Except for a brief interregnum (1399–1405), Seoul was the capital of Korea from 1394 until the formal division of the country in 1948. 
  The name itself has come to mean “capital” in the Korean language. The city was popularly called Seoul in Korean during both the Chosŏn (Yi) 
  dynasty (1392–1910) and the period of Japanese rule (1910–45), although the official names in those periods were Hansŏng (Hanseong) and Kyŏngsŏng 
  (Gyeongseong), respectively. The city was also popularly and, during most of the 14th century, officially known as Hanyang. Seoul became the official 
  name of the city only with the founding of South Korea in 1948. Area 234 square miles (605 square km). Pop. (2010) 9,794,304.</p>
