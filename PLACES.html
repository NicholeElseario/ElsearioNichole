  <p>This must-see attraction in Seoul showcases the incredible history and artwork of Korea and the Korean people.
  The museum, one of the largest in Asia, is in the city's Yongsan District (close to Itaewon). It focuses on archeology, history, and art
  and includes a vast collection of works and objects going back more than a million years. There are ancient and prehistoric artifacts,
  sculpture, paintings, and other artwork along with a large collection of objects and antiques. <b>Address: 137 Seobinggo-ro, Seobinggo-dong, Yongsan-gu.</b></p>

  <p>First built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of Seoul's five grand palaces built during the powerful Joseon dynasty.
  Destroyed and rebuilt several times over the centuries, it was restored to its original glory after the Second World War and totally restored in the 1990s.
  Within the palace grounds, you can also find the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea, and both are worth a
  visit. The palace museum is especially fascinating as it presents items from the palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. This includes priceless
  antiques and artwork, as well as everyday items for cooking, cleaning, and daily life. The National Folk Museum focuses on items from daily life,
  as well as clothing and dioramas, to tell the story of the Korean people since prehistoric times.
  <b>Address: 161 Sajik-ro, Sejongno, Jongno-gu, Seoul.</b></p>
