  <p>Rising almost 500 meters above the city, this communications and observation tower provides dramatic views of the city from its perch on the
  side of Mount Namsan. A cable car whisks you up the side of the mountain to the base of the tower. From here, you can go up in the tower and visit
  any one of four observation decks, one of which is a rotating restaurant.

There are five different dining experiences at the N Seoul Tower and, of course, several gift shops. The n.GRILL, on the top level,
is considered one of Seoul's best French fine-dining restaurants. Be sure to visit the new Inside Seoul immersive media art exhibition, where 40 laser
projectors create a virtual display of the city via five-dimensional mapping, with the tower at the center.

<p>For a taste of Korean traditional culture and architecture, a visit to the Bukchon Hanok Village is a fun and educational way to spend an afternoon.
This preserved district of several ancient neighborhoods gives you a feel for what it was like to live in Korea 600 years ago. It's right in central Seoul,
in the area between the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Changdeokgung Palace.

The neighborhoods of narrow streets feature hanoks or traditional Korean houses. It's a unique place, as it's a historic area, very popular with tourists,
but it's also a real neighborhood because the houses are all occupied. Some of the hanoks are now guesthouses and bed-and-breakfasts, and a few are museums
and can be toured. Others are cultural centers showcasing traditional crafts
and other historic aspects of Korean life, but most are private homes.</p>
