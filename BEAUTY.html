  <p><b>“When it comes to beauty, what Americans consider luxury, Koreans consider maintenance,”</b> says Los Angeles–based Christina Han,
  former editorial director of the high-end beauty site Violet Grey and founder of the consulting firm Type Navy. “In Seoul,
  facials are part of the daily routine.”

  For years, kimchi and kalbi have lured us en masse to South Korea’s capital, but a growing number of sheet-mask fanatics and influencers are
  flying the 7,000 miles for snail-mucin serums and wrinkle-banishing Fraxel laser treatments. (Think of it as a farther-flung version of
  Costa Rica’s wellness tourism, but with better BBQ.)

  Some quick history: Back in the eighties, a few French beauty brands outsourced production to Korea; then, in the aughts, Koreans began
  to use the existing labs to manufacture their own higher-quality, lower-priced products. K-beauty blogs like Soko Glam started demystifying
  multistep skin-care regimes for Americans, helping to drive the $3.97 billion in cosmetics exports last year, and social media did the rest.
  Recently, we’ve watched beauty junkies like Han, the Hollywood makeup guru Lisa Eldridge, and Drew Barrymore (there to research her line, Flower
  Beauty) work through Seoul’s beauty emporiums on Instagram.</p>
